A Red Octocat
Went to the store to buy some milk. 
In the way back he say a strange glow coming out of a house. 
I should mind my own business, he thought, but he had never been the kind of cat that minded its own business. So he approached the house, and looked into the window, and what he saw that day changed its life. For ever.
